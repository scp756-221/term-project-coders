# SFU CMPT 756
#
# Istio yaml to deploy a VirtualService
#
# This version demonstrates a simple "canary" deployment.
# It assumes that two versions of service S2 have
# been deployed, v1 and v2. It uses the Istio traffic-shaping
# features to split the traffic 90% to v1 and 10% to v2
#
# DestinationRule lists the subset destination Kubernetes Services
# that will receive traffic from the Istio VirtualService.
# VirtualService routes URLs to the destinations, splitting the traffic
# across destinations according to weights.
